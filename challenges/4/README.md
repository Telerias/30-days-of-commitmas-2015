## Overview

To full participate in #Commitmas, you will need to have a working environment to work with repositores and associated files.
For this challenge all you'll need is a git client.
In this challenge we'll cover the most basic Git commands: Clone, Add, Commit and Push.

## The Challenge

# Step 1
Understand the various "places": workspace, staging, local repository, remote respository.

# Step 2
Cover the commands that move from state to state.
  * "Add" will move things to staging. That is, tell Git that this is something we want to track.
  * A "Commit" is telling Git that we have some changes we want to save to our local repository. 
  * "Push" places our commits in the remote repository.
  * A "Clone" (or a "Pull") brings a remote repository into your local workspace.

# Step 3
Demo: Clone a repo. 

# Step 4
Demo: Add a file, commit it, and push it.
